# Contributing to Barefoot

Barefoot is maintained by volunteers, so contributions are welcome.

## Reporting bugs

Before creating an issue first check if your bug hasn't already been reported by searching existing and closed issue. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible:

* Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
* Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible.
* Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. Make sure someone else can easily try your example.
* Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.

## New features

If you have an idea for a new features, open an issue for this. 

* Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement.
* Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most users. What are the use-cases and how needed are they?
* Discuss some of the trade-offs, such as code complexity and performance.

Note that since Barefoot is maintained by volunteers, you are most likely the best person to implement your own idea. But to make sure your hard work gets merged in the main repository, first gather feedback from users and maintainers.

## Minor improvements

If you spot some existing functionality that could use a bit of work, you can either open an issue to point it out, or even better, directly open a PR with the improvement.


## Code style

### Tests
Add tests for any new functionality you create. If you're touching existing code without test coverage, adding tests is very welcome.

### Java
Maximum line width is 100 characters.

### Python
Stick to regular PEP8:

https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

Line width is the same as in the Java code: 100 chars.
